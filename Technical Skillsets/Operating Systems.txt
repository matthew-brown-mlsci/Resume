Operating Systems (direct experience):

•	Windows (3.1/95/98/XP/7/8/10)
	- Installation/Configuration/Administrative duties/Troubleshooting/etc
	- I've been installing/configuring Windows OS's @ home since ~1994.  I've re-imaged a number of PC's (win7 x86/x64, Win10) in the
	  course of being employed @ Wheaton Franciscan Healthcare, and was entrusted with administrator rights on all PCs enterprise-wide.
	- I'm familiar administrating PC's that live in an enterprise corporate domain, AD concepts and usage, etc.
•	Windows Server (NT 4.0, 2000, 2003, 2008, 2008R2, 2012, 2016)
	- Installation/Configuration/Administrative duties/Troubleshooting/etc
	- I hold administrative privileges on dozens of Windows Server instances @ Ascension Technologies, and regularly use various
	  admin functions to provide thorough support.  
	- I have installed/used all of these versions at various times @ my home lab.
•	Linux (Redhat, Slackware, Ubuntu)
	- I have installed/used various Linux distributions, starting back in ~1995.
	- @ Ascension Technologies, I regularly use the CLI on various clinical application servers (Enterprise Redhat) to solve various
	  issues as they arise.  I like using Bash, and definitely enjoy using the various GNU utilities to expedite solving problems.
•	FreeBSD, OpenBSD, NetBSD
	- I've had a machine @ home running FreeBSD since ~1995
	- My name is in the kernel source as a minor contributor! (matt@dqc.org)
	- I Built/maintain my current FreeBSD server \w ZFS implementation (15 discs to SAS HBA).  Server hosts a mix of FreeBSD / Windows 
	  virtual hosts, as well as a MySQL instance, PostgreSQL instance, iSCSI targets to ZFS (targets used by ESXi hosts), PF firewall,
	  Samba server, etc.  Uptime ~2 years.
	- I've installed/used either OpenBSD or NetBSD on a variety of architecture targets, i386, amd64, sparc, alpha, powerpc, next68k,
	  sun3, sgimips, mips.  To my wife's dismay, I still have the hardware for several of these architectures in my basement.
•	HP-UX, AIX
	- I've supported various clinical systems (hospital registration/billing, ambulatory registration/billing, etc) that had app
	  servers running HP-UX or AIX.  I have carte blanche sudo access to these systems, and worked with the system engineers
	  regularly on technical issues.
•	Solaris, Irix, NeXTSTEP
	- Installation/Configuration
	- I used to re-sell Sun & SGI hardware on eBay.  As such I have a long history installing both Solaris and Irix.
	- Fun fact, I still have a NextStation 030 Cube in my basement, which I have installed/provisioned/etc.
•	ESXi hypervisor
	- Install/configure to x64 target, remote configuration via VMWare vSphere & VMWare windows vSphere app
•	Some limited exposure to IBM z/OS / MVS / MUSIC/SP, VMS, OpenVMS, Minix.
	- I am occasionally involved in a mainframe process @ Ascension Technologies, and as such have access to Cerner mainframe
	  time leased by Ascension.
	- I have installed OpenVMS on a DEC Alpha.  
	- I've done troubleshooting on a VMS emulator used for clinical information archiving while working for WFHC
	- I installed Minix \w X on a 386 \w 2MB of memory a very long time ago.
